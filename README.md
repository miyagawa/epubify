# epubify

This is a tiny web app that does:

- Accepts [IFTTT Maker](https://ifttt.com/maker) request with a URL
- Makes an anonymous [Readlists](http://readlists.com) list
- Download EPUB generated by Readlists
- Upload to Dropbox folder

Ideal use is to deploy on Heroku, then connect tagged items on Pocket/Instapaper on IFTTT. Whenever you tag an item with 'longreads', it creates a new epub on your Dropbox folder.
